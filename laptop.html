<h4 id="laptop-definition">Laptop definition</h4>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop">laptop</a> computer or notebook computer, also known as a laptop or
    notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a
    flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of
    the lower lid.</p>
<p>Most of the computer&#39;s internal hardware is fitted inside the lower lid enclosure under the keyboard, although
    many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In
    most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating
    systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.</p>
<h4 id="types-of-laptops">Types of laptops</h4>
<h5 id="smaller-and-larger-laptops">Smaller and larger laptops</h5>
<p>There were in the past a number of marketing categories for smaller and larger laptop computers; these included
    &quot;notebook&quot; and &quot;subnotebook&quot; models, low cost &quot;netbooks&quot;, and &quot;ultra-mobile
    PCs&quot; where the size class overlapped with devices like smartphone and handheld tablets, and &quot;Desktop
    replacement&quot; laptops for machines notably larger and heavier than typical to operate more powerful processors
    or graphics hardware.</p>
<h5 id="convertible-hybrid-2-in-1">Convertible, hybrid, 2-in-1</h5>
<p>The latest trend of technological convergence in the portable computer industry spawned a broad range of devices,
    which combined features of several previously separate device types. The hybrids, convertibles, and 2-in-1s emerged
    as crossover devices, which share traits of both tablets and laptops. All such devices have a touchscreen display
    designed to allow users to work in a tablet mode, using either multi-touch gestures or a stylus/digital pen.</p>
<h5 id="rugged-laptop">Rugged laptop</h5>
<p>A rugged laptop is designed to reliably operate in harsh usage conditions such as strong vibrations, extreme
    temperatures, and wet or dusty environments. Rugged laptops are bulkier, heavier, and much more expensive than
    regular laptops,[47] and thus are seldom seen in regular consumer use.</p>
<h4 id="laptop-hardware">Laptop hardware</h4>
<p> The basic components of laptops function identically to their desktop counterparts. Traditionally they were
    miniaturized and adapted to mobile use, The design restrictions on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the
    maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components, although that difference has
    increasingly narrowed.</p>
